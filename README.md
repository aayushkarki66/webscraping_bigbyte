# webscraping_bigbyte
This project is the result of 15 days online classes of Basic Python Training where we were able to learn all the basics of python. This is a webscraping project where I scrap some top 50 laptops with their brand name, short description and prices from one renown online shopping sites of Nepal called Bigbyte.
